The big advantage of arrays is that you can access an arbitrary element in constant
time; the big disadvantage is that you cannot make them larger without potentially re-
creating the array. Because arrays permit constant-time random access to elements, it is
easy to use arrays to implement, for example, a stack. You would simply use a counter
to track how much of the array is in use at any given time, and perform all pushes and
pops at the end of the used portion of the array.

Things become much more interesting if you want to hold more than one stack within
the same array.

For this problem, you are to imagine that you are working on a system with a severely
limited amount of memory, within which you must maintain three stacks. Specifically,
there is starter code that declares an array large enough to hold 21 ints. You don't have
direct access to the array, but you have access to functions put and get to store and
retrieve items from the array. You must maintain three stacks within that array. The
input to your program will come from standard input (the keyboard, or redirected from
a file), and will look like the following:

```
u 0 22
u 2 45
u 6 33
o 0
o 0
```

The first field of each line will always be u (pUsh) or o (pOp). The second field will be
either 0, 1, or 2, indicating which stack to do the push or pop on. If the operation is a
push, then there will be an additional number saying what to push. You can use the %c
option to read a character with scanf. You must carry out the given operation on the
given stack. Whenever the operation is a pop, you must print to standard output (i.e.,
the screen, possibly redirected) the item that was popped, followed by a newline
character. For the input above, the output should be

```
33
22
```

The program will also print the total number of reads and writes to the array issued by
your program.

You are guaranteed that the input to your program will never store more than 21
numbers at a time, but no guarantees are made about how many integers might go into
any individual stack. Your program must produce correct answers without storing the
items into any auxiliary data structuresâ€” your system doesn't have that much memory!
You can use a variable to store the input as you read it, but after that, it has to go into
the array. You can have variables (some of which can be organized into an array of size
3 if you want a version of the variables for each stack) to store information about
which parts of the array belong to which stack. Variables whose purpose is to assist
with the running of your program (i.e., not related to the stacks themselves, or the data
they hold) are permitted. Hand-marking will be done to ensure that none of these rules
are broken; if you break the rules, hand-marking will revoke all marks awarded by
Marmoset.

**Clarification**: You can use variables in any way you want, as long as they are not
replicating the array, or storing values that should be in the array. As stated above, you
can use a variable to hold the array item as you read it in, but after that, you can't hold
onto it; it must be stored in the array. If you are not sure whether your approach is OK,
ask yourself the following: the array had 1000000 elements instead of 21, would you
need more variables? If so, then you are not operating within the spirit of this problem
A bonus will be given to the (correct) submission for which the total number of reads
and writes is the smallest. If multiple correct submissions tie for the fewest reads and
writes, all such submissions will receive the bonus.
